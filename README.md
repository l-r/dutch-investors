Dutch seed investors
===============
Amsterdam is slowly growing a startup ecosystem. Young Dutch entrepreneurs are building their first companies. Startup machines like [Startup Bootcamp](http://www.startupbootcamp.org/accelerator/amsterdam.html) and [Rockstart](http://rockstart.com) attract talent from all over the world and grow strong startup networks. Seasoned entrepreneurs take newbies under their wings and push them to do better. Extremely driven entrepreneurs sharing their mistakes, best practices, and motivate eachother when things get rough. More and more startups in Amsterdam dare to think big.  
Meeting these bright founders and hearing them out on their bold ideas and plans to raise their first seed funding, we often feel a big disconnect between the perception of available venture capital and the current investment landscape in Amsterdam. Their shortlist of investors often only include the few Dutch funds that have a very limited dealflow and barely do any seed funding. 

We hope this living document can help to shine some light on smart seed stage venture capital available to startups in The Netherlands. By listing *active* seed investors and their most *recent* deals (2012-now), we can help early stage startups to get an understanding of seed funding in pretty little Dutch ecosystem and point them in the right direction for stronger introductions. 

We need to your help to draw this picture. Send us your comments or even better, contribute to this repository.
